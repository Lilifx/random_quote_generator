# random_quote_generator
Goals
When I click on the button “show another quote” I should be able to get a random quote.

Specifications

For this mini-project, you can either use arrays to store quotes and display them after clicking the “show another quote” button or you can use JavaScript async/await with the fetch API to pull random quotes (BONUS). 
Be sure to style the page in the way you prefer. It does not need to look exactly like the example. 
Remember you are manipulating DOM elements, so use all you learned this week: Creating elements, getting elements, and creating  “click” events. 

Deploy your code on Github pages or Netlify.
